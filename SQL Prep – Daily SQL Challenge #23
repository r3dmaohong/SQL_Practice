-- CHALLENGE: This is a continuation of challenge #14. To recap, in challenge #14 we want to see a history of orders and payments by customer # 363. This time, we want the same information (customer number, order/payment date, and order/payment amount), but we also want to include a running total of their balance as a fourth column.


-- memo
-- OVER: Doing stuff one by one (by row).
WITH tmp AS(
SELECT o.customerNumber
	, o.orderDate
	, SUM(od.quantityOrdered*od.priceEach)*(-1) AS subTotal
FROM orderdetails od
JOIN orders o ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
WHERE o.customerNumber = 363
GROUP BY o.customerNumber, o.orderDate
UNION -- Just like "rbind" in R.
SELECT p.customerNumber
	, p.paymentDate
	, p.amount

WHERE p.customerNumber = 363

SELECT *, SUM(subTotal) OVER(ORDER BY tmp.orderDate) AS running_total
