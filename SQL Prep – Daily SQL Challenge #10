--Show each customer number, and then the number of orders they have by status type. So you will have a column for customer number, and then one column each for shipped, in process, cancelled, disputed, resolved, and on hold.

WITH shipped AS(
 SELECT o.customerNumber,

-- Ans

	, SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'on hold' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'on hold'

GROUP BY customerNumber
