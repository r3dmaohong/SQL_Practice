-- CHALLENGE: Using the WORLD database, we want to see if there is a correlation between population and life expectancy. Show each country's name, population rank (1 being the highest, and on down from there), life expectancy rank (same), and overall score (population rank + life expectancy rank).
SELECT name
	, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Population DESC) AS p
	, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC) AS l
	, (RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Population DESC) + RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC)) as t
FROM country
ORDER BY 't'


-- Ans
WITH rank_base AS
(
SELECT name
	, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY population DESC) AS pr
	, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC) AS ler
FROM country
)
SELECT name
	, pr AS 'Population Rank (DESC)'
	, ler AS 'Life Expectancy Rank (DESC)'
	, pr + ler AS 'Total Rank'
FROM rank_base
ORDER BY 'Total Rank'
