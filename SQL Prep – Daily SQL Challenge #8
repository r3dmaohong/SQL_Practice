-- Show each office city, and the average number of orders per employee per office (without displaying the individual employee average). For example, say office ABC has 2 employees. Employee #1 was responsible for 2 orders, and employee #2 was responsible for 6 orders. Then your result set should show ABC for the first column (city), and 4 for the second column (avg orders per employee per office: (2+6)/2).

	SELECT e.officeCode

	, COUNT(o.orderNumber) AS order_count

	LEFT JOIN customers c ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber
	LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
	GROUP BY e.officeCode, e.employeeNumber
